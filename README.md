# Crop Pest Classification with CNNs using ShufflenetV2

This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the ShufflenetV2 architecture, for the classification of crop pests using the IP102 dataset. The aim is to develop a robust model capable of accurately identifying and categorizing various pests that commonly affect crops.
